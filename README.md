## Purpose
Secret Gigs allows bands to connect with their fan-base in a live setting during COVID times. Due to audience restrictions and venues being generally closed, this app allows fans to attend events in secret locations for a limited number of attendees by a random selection process. The idea is to keep the social distancing and safety measures in place, while allowing safe and controlled events.

## Functionality / features
## Target audience
Specific bands fan-base, music, concert and live music enthusiasts that haven't attended any live gigs due to current events. This also works under "normal" conditions, having the ability to increase the attendees per venue as needed.
